- Test the game with attack mechanics
    - Fix printing newlines for substates (summon and defense)
    - Refactor attack (monster/ml) and (defending/nondefendig) to avoid code duplication?
    - add attack crest cost for attacking
- Refactor game_states to make them indepentend of display format (possible?)
