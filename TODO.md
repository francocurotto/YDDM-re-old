- Test Dicepool+DiceHand+CrestPool+Player
    - fix "dice hand full" message when used quick roll with dice hand full
- transfer functionalities from test_player to player? (will this fix multiple newline in quickroll?)
- is dice hand really necesary if dice for roll can be selected directly from dice pool?
- or maybe keep dice hand and dice pool but make player handle dice in pool availability
