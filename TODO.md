- Test Dicepool+DiceHand+CrestPool+Player
    - fix quick roll when using dice already in hand
- transfer functionalities from test_player to player?
- is dice hand really necesary if dice for roll can be selected directly from dice pool?
- or maybe keep dice hand and dice pool but make player handle dice in pool availability
