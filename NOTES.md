Started coding the game. The idea is to start simple and just
with the dice object. At first everything will be just text
printed in the terminal.

Finish dice object and test. Should consider in the future a
way to change the crest character at runtime. There is a bug
where pretty unicode characters overlap with other characters,
specifically sword and shield have this problem.

The next step is to implement the ddm-dice object and test it.
After that we can go with the player object, the dicepool, and
the "dice hand" (maybe change name).

Finish tests if ddm-dice object. Of course, the object will
continue to have new funcionalities as the game development
progress. 

Now the next steps is a little bit more funny: player, 
dicepool and dicehand (for now is dice hand). The real fun 
will start when we start to program the dungeon place.
